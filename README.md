### Powerful, modern networking and caching for SwiftUI 

**Loadability** is a powerful, modern networking and caching library 



## Requirements

**Loadability** supports **iOS 14+**, **macOS 11+**, and **watchOS 7+**. It does not have any dependencies.

## Installation

You can use **Loadability** as a Swift Package, or add it manually to your project. 

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Swift Package Manager is a way to add dependencies to your app, and is natively integrated with Xcode.

To add **Loadability** with SPM, click `File` â–º `Swift Packages` â–º `Add Package Dependency...`, then type in the URL to this Github repo. Xcode will then add the package to your project and perform all the necessary work to build it.

```
https://github.com/julianschiavo/Loadability
```

Alternatively, add the package to your `Package.swift` file.

```swift
let package = Package(
    // ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/julianschiavo/Loadability.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    // ...
)
```

*See [SPM documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/master/Documentation) to learn more.*

### Manually

If you prefer not to use SPM, you can also add **Loadability** as a normal framework by building the library from this repository. (See other sources for instructions on doing this.)
